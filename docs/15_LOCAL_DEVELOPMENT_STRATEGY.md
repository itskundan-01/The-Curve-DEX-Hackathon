# Local Development Strategy

## Components Safe to Develop Locally (Portable)

### ✅ **Core Business Logic** (100% portable)
- `LimitOrderEngine` class and order management
- Order policies (GTC, IOC, FOK) implementation  
- Price comparison and slippage calculation logic
- Order state machine transitions
- Configuration parsing and validation

### ✅ **Utility Libraries** (95% portable)
- JSON parsing and serialization helpers
- Mathematical utilities (price normalization, decimals)
- Logging framework and structured output
- Error handling and exception classes
- Time utilities and scheduling logic

### ✅ **Abstract Interfaces** (90% portable)
- `IEthereumClient` interface definition
- `ICurveService` interface definition
- `IERC20Service` interface definition
- `IOrderStorage` interface definition
- Mock implementations for testing

### ⚠️ **Platform-Specific Components** (Develop templates locally)
- HTTP client implementation (may need to adapt to GoCode libraries)
- Cryptographic signing (secp256k1) - library availability may vary
- File I/O and persistence (adapt to GoCode filesystem)
- Threading/async patterns (may need to match provided patterns)

## Local Development Setup

### Dependencies to Install Locally:
```bash
# Core C++ tools
brew install cmake
brew install nlohmann-json
brew install openssl
brew install curl

# Optional for crypto (if available)
brew install secp256k1
```

### Project Structure to Mirror Expected GoCode Layout:
```
src/
├── core/
│   ├── LimitOrderEngine.hpp/cpp
│   ├── Order.hpp/cpp
│   └── OrderPolicies.hpp/cpp
├── interfaces/
│   ├── IEthereumClient.hpp
│   ├── ICurveService.hpp
│   └── IERC20Service.hpp
├── services/
│   ├── EthereumClient.hpp/cpp
│   ├── CurveService.hpp/cpp
│   └── ERC20Service.hpp/cpp
├── utils/
│   ├── Config.hpp/cpp
│   ├── Logger.hpp/cpp
│   └── Math.hpp/cpp
└── mocks/
    └── MockEthereumClient.hpp/cpp
```

### Testing Framework:
```cpp
// Use standard testing that's likely to be available
#include <cassert>
#include <iostream>

// Or if available locally and in GoCode:
#include <gtest/gtest.h>
```

## Migration Strategy to GoCode

### Step 1: Copy Core Logic (5 minutes)
- Drop in your `core/` and `utils/` directories
- These should work as-is

### Step 2: Adapt Interfaces (15-30 minutes)  
- Examine provided starter interfaces
- Adapt your implementations to match signatures
- May need to rename methods or adjust parameters

### Step 3: Platform Integration (30-60 minutes)
- Replace HTTP client with GoCode-provided libraries
- Adapt crypto signing to available libraries
- Adjust build system to provided CMake setup

### Step 4: Wire Everything Together (30 minutes)
- Update main.cpp to use provided entry points
- Ensure configuration loads from expected sources
- Verify all tests still pass

## What to Focus on Locally

### High Priority (Start These Now):
1. **Order Management Logic** - This will be 100% portable
2. **Price Calculation & Slippage** - Pure math, totally portable  
3. **State Machine & Policies** - Business logic, will transfer directly
4. **Unit Tests** - Will help validate after migration

### Medium Priority:
1. **Mock Implementations** - Will help with integration testing
2. **Configuration System** - May need parameter adjustments
3. **Logging Framework** - Structure will be portable, output may change

### Low Priority (Wait for GoCode):
1. **HTTP Implementation** - Library dependencies unknown
2. **Crypto Signing** - Library availability unclear
3. **File I/O** - Filesystem access patterns may differ

## Risk Mitigation

### If Starter Code is Very Different:
- Your core logic stays the same
- Only integration layer needs changes
- Interfaces provide clean abstraction boundary

### If Libraries are Limited:
- Implement minimal versions of needed functionality
- Your math and business logic remains unchanged
- HTTP can be done with basic libraries if needed

## Time Savings Estimate

**Local Development Benefits:**
- Save 4-6 hours on core logic development
- Have working unit tests before entering time pressure
- Reduce GoCode learning curve to integration only
- Enter hackathon with 60-70% of code already working

**Migration Time Cost:**
- 1-2 hours maximum for adaptation
- Still leaves 22+ hours for integration, testing, and polish

## Bottom Line

**YES - Start developing the core logic locally right now!** 

The business logic, order management, and mathematical components will be 100% portable. You'll enter the hackathon with a huge head start and only need to adapt the integration layer.

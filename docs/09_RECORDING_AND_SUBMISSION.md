# Recording & Submission Checklist

Produce a short narrated demo (5–8 minutes) covering design and a live run.

## Recording Script
1) Intro (30s): Challenge summary and approach
2) Architecture (1m): Walk through key modules in docs
3) Config (30s): Show env and CLI help
4) Tests (1m): Run unit tests; highlight key cases
5) Live Demo (2–3m): Start engine, submit order, show logs and tx on explorer
6) Design choices (1m): Policies, slippage, retries
7) Wrap-up (30s): Limitations and next steps

## Tips
- Use a small trade amount for safety
- Keep terminal font large
- Mention chain and pool explicitly

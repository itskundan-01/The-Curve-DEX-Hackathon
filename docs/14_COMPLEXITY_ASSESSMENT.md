# Project Complexity Assessment

## Difficulty Level: **Challenging but Achievable** (7/10)

### Core Challenges Ranked by Difficulty:

#### 1. **Medium Complexity** - Ethereum Integration
- JSON-RPC calls are straightforward HTTP
- Transaction signing has well-established patterns
- Gas estimation and EIP-1559 are documented
- **Time estimate**: 4-6 hours

#### 2. **Low-Medium Complexity** - Curve Finance Integration  
- Well-documented smart contract interfaces
- `get_dy` and `exchange` functions are standard
- Token approvals follow ERC-20 patterns
- **Time estimate**: 2-3 hours

#### 3. **Medium Complexity** - Limit Order Engine
- Business logic is straightforward
- State machine with clear transitions
- Policy implementation (GTC/IOC/FOK) is logical
- **Time estimate**: 3-4 hours

#### 4. **Low Complexity** - C++ Architecture
- Modern C++ with good library ecosystem
- HTTP clients, JSON parsing are solved problems
- Modular design reduces coupling
- **Time estimate**: 2-3 hours

#### 5. **Unknown Complexity** - Starter Code Integration
- Biggest wildcard in the project
- Could be trivial or require significant refactoring
- **Time estimate**: 1-4 hours (highly variable)

### Risk Mitigation Strategies:

#### High Priority:
1. **Starter Code Adaptation**: Build flexible interfaces that can adapt
2. **Incremental Development**: Get basic flow working first, then enhance
3. **Fallback Plans**: Mock heavy components if integration fails

#### Medium Priority:
1. **Testing Strategy**: Unit tests for core logic, mocks for blockchain
2. **Error Handling**: Robust retry/backoff for network issues
3. **Configuration**: Environment-based config for quick parameter changes

### Success Probability Breakdown:

- **90% chance**: Basic blockchain connection and simple trades
- **80% chance**: Full limit order engine with all policies
- **70% chance**: Comprehensive testing and error handling
- **60% chance**: Polished demo with complex scenarios

### Time Allocation Recommendation:

```
Phase 1 (Hours 0-6): Foundation
- Starter code integration: 2h
- Basic blockchain client: 2h
- Simple token operations: 2h

Phase 2 (Hours 6-12): Core Features  
- Curve integration: 3h
- Limit order engine: 3h

Phase 3 (Hours 12-18): Integration
- End-to-end flows: 3h
- Testing and debugging: 3h

Phase 4 (Hours 18-24): Polish
- Error handling: 2h
- Demo preparation: 2h
- Recording and submission: 2h
```

### Key Insights:
- **This is a well-scoped hackathon challenge** - complex enough to be interesting, simple enough to complete
- **Your preparation gives you a significant advantage** - most participants will spend hours just understanding requirements
- **The modular architecture allows for incremental success** - even a partial implementation can be impressive
- **C++ choice is smart** - performance benefits and shows technical depth

### Bottom Line:
**Yes, this is absolutely doable for someone with your level of preparation.** The key is aggressive time management and focusing on core functionality first, polish later.

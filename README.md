# Curve Finance Trading Agent (C++): Hackathon Blueprint

This repo contains the complete planning and documentation to build a C++ trading agent that interfaces with the Ethereum blockchain and Curve Finance DEX. It’s tailored for the GoQuant 24-hour hackathon and designed for quick execution, clear structure, and robust, testable engineering.

Use the docs to guide development when the challenge window starts. Once you confirm, we’ll scaffold the codebase and follow this plan end-to-end.

## What’s here
- Challenge overview and requirements
- Architecture and data flows
- Detailed development plan and 24-hour timeline
- Ethereum/Curve integration notes (JSON-RPC, ABI, signing, approvals)
- Limit-order engine design and order schema
- Test strategy (unit, integration, e2e) and cases
- Ops/runbook, risks, submission/recording checklist

See `docs/` to start.

## Next step
When you confirm, we’ll generate the C++ project, wire dependencies, implement the modules per this plan, and run smoke tests.

# Curve DEX Limit Order Agent - GoQuant Hackathon Solution

A sophisticated C++ trading agent that executes limit orders on Curve DEX with advanced Time-in-Force (TIF) policies, real-time price monitoring, and comprehensive slippage protection.

## Hackathon Challenge Compliance

This implementation fully addresses all three parts of the GoQuant Hackathon Challenge:

### Part 1: On-Chain Price Monitoring
- **RPC Provider**: Sepolia testnet via `https://eth-sepolia.public.blastapi.io`
- **Balance Fetching**: Real-time ETH and ERC-20 token balance queries
- **Price Monitoring**: Continuous `get_dy` calls for real-time Curve pool pricing

### Part 2: Limit Order Agent with TIF Policies
- **GTC (Good-Till-Canceled)**: Monitors indefinitely until target price
- **GTT (Good-Till-Time)**: Executes within time window or expires
- **IOC (Immediate-Or-Cancel)**: Executes immediately or cancels
- **FOK (Fill-Or-Kill)**: All-or-nothing execution
- **Slippage Protection**: Configurable tolerance for safe execution

### Part 3: Comprehensive Testing Suite
- **Unit Tests**: Core functionality validation
- **End-to-End Tests**: Complete workflow testing
- **Live Demonstrations**: Working examples of all TIF policies

## Quick Start Guide

### Prerequisites
```bash
# Required system dependencies
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y \
   build-essential \
   cmake \
   libcurl4-openssl-dev \
   nlohmann-json3-dev

# Or on macOS with Homebrew:
brew install cmake curl nlohmann-json
```

### Troubleshooting Dependencies

If you encounter "nlohmann_json not found" error in online environments:

```bash
# Try installing via apt
sudo apt install nlohmann-json3-dev

# If that fails, manual installation:
sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/include/nlohmann
sudo wget -O /usr/local/include/nlohmann/json.hpp \
    https://github.com/nlohmann/json/releases/download/v3.11.3/json.hpp

# Then retry build
cd build && rm -rf * && cmake .. && make
```

### Compilation
```bash
# Clone or navigate to project directory
cd hackathon-submission

# Create build directory
mkdir -p build && cd build

# Configure and compile
cmake ..
make

# Verify successful build
ls -la curve_limit_order_agent
```

### Running the Agent
```bash
# Start the interactive agent
./curve_limit_order_agent

# The system will display:
# - Connection status to Sepolia testnet
# - Real-time price monitoring initialization
# - Interactive command interface
```

## Complete Usage Walkthrough

### 1. Starting the System
```bash
./curve_limit_order_agent
```

**Expected Output:**
```

```

### 2. Available Commands
```bash
# View all available commands
help

# Check wallet balance (demonstrates Part 1: Balance Fetching)
balance

# Monitor real-time prices (demonstrates Part 1: Price Monitoring)
price USDC

# Create limit orders (demonstrates Part 2: TIF Policies)
order create GTC USDC DAI 1000 1.001 0.5

# View active orders
order list

# Execute testing suite (demonstrates Part 3: Testing)
test comprehensive
```

### 3. Creating Different Order Types

#### GTC Order (Good-Till-Canceled)
```bash
curve-agent> order create GTC USDC DAI 1000 1.001 0.5
Order created successfully! ID: GTC_001
Monitoring until price >= 1.001 USDC/DAI
```

#### GTT Order (Good-Till-Time)
```bash
curve-agent> order create GTT USDC DAI 500 0.999 0.5 3600
Order created successfully! ID: GTT_001
Will expire in 3600 seconds if not filled
```

#### IOC Order (Immediate-Or-Cancel)
```bash
curve-agent> order create IOC USDC DAI 2000 1.002 0.5
Order created successfully! ID: IOC_001
Checking for immediate execution...
[If price not met: Order canceled - price requirement not met]
[If price met: Executing order immediately...]
```

#### FOK Order (Fill-Or-Kill)
```bash
curve-agent> order create FOK USDC DAI 5000 1.000 0.5
Order created successfully! ID: FOK_001
Checking if entire order can be filled...
[Executes entirely or cancels completely]
```

### 4. Real-Time Price Monitoring Demo
```bash
curve-agent> price monitor USDC DAI 30
Starting 30-second price monitoring demonstration...
[Timestamp] USDC/DAI: 1.0023 (Target examples: GTC>=1.001, IOC>=1.002)
[Timestamp] USDC/DAI: 1.0019 (Price movement detected)
[Timestamp] USDC/DAI: 1.0025 (All conditions favorable)
```

### 5. Comprehensive Testing Suite
```bash
curve-agent> test comprehensive
Starting comprehensive test suite...

```

## Security Implementation (Bonus Task)

### Wallet Security Best Practices
```bash
# Test wallet specifically created for hackathon
WALLET_ADDRESS="0x0dc7987e20953546F50c92CbC9d45A8baf638690"
NETWORK="Sepolia Testnet"
FUNDING_SOURCE="sepoliafaucet.com"

# Security measures implemented:
# Fresh wallet (never used for mainnet)
# Testnet only (zero mainnet exposure)
# Faucet funding (no personal funds at risk)
# Environment variable key management
```

### Verifying Security
```bash
curve-agent> wallet info
Current wallet: 0x0dc7987e20953546F50c92CbC9d45A8baf638690
Network: Sepolia Testnet
Balance: [Current ETH balance] ETH
Security: Testnet-only wallet (no mainnet risk)
```

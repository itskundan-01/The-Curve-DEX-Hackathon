# Curve DEX Limit Order Agent - GoQuant Hackathon Solution

A comprehensive C++ trading agent that executes limit orders on Curve DEX with advanced Time-in-Force (TIF) policies, real-time price monitoring, and intelligent user interface controls. This implementation demonstrates production-quality trading system architecture with full blockchain integration on Sepolia testnet.

## Hackathon Challenge Implementation

This solution fully addresses all three required components of the GoQuant Hackathon Challenge:

### Part 1: On-Chain Price Monitoring
- **RPC Integration**: Direct connection to Sepolia testnet via `https://eth-sepolia.public.blastapi.io`
- **Balance Queries**: Real-time ETH and ERC-20 token balance fetching using web3 calls
- **Price Monitoring**: Continuous `get_dy` calls to Curve pools for live pricing data
- **Multi-Source Pricing**: Integration with CoinGecko and 1inch APIs for enhanced accuracy

### Part 2: Limit Order Agent with TIF Policies
- **GTC (Good-Till-Canceled)**: Orders remain active until target price is reached
- **GTT (Good-Till-Time)**: Orders expire after specified time period
- **IOC (Immediate-Or-Cancel)**: Orders execute immediately if conditions are met, otherwise cancel
- **FOK (Fill-Or-Kill)**: Orders execute completely or cancel entirely (no partial fills)
- **Slippage Protection**: Configurable tolerance levels to prevent unfavorable execution

### Part 3: Comprehensive Testing and Validation
- **Automated Testing**: Built-in test suite validating all core functionality
- **Live Integration**: Real blockchain interaction with Sepolia testnet
- **End-to-End Workflows**: Complete order lifecycle testing from submission to execution

## Wallet Configuration and Safety

### Dedicated Test Wallet Setup
For this hackathon demonstration, I created a dedicated Sepolia testnet wallet:

```
Wallet Address: 0x0dc7987e20953546F50c92CbC9d45A8baf638690
Network: Sepolia Testnet (Chain ID: 11155111)
Private Key: Configured in code for demonstration purposes
Funding: Obtained free testnet ETH from sepoliafaucet.com
```

### MetaMask Integration
I added this wallet to MetaMask with the following setup:
1. Added Sepolia testnet to MetaMask network list
2. Imported the wallet using the private key
3. Funded the wallet with testnet ETH from public faucets
4. Verified all transactions can be viewed on Etherscan Sepolia

### Safety Measures
The system is designed with multiple safety layers:
- **Testnet Only**: All operations occur on Sepolia testnet, never mainnet
- **DEMO Mode Default**: Real blockchain data with simulated transactions
- **No Real Value**: Testnet tokens have no monetary value
- **Dedicated Wallet**: Fresh wallet created specifically for this hackathon
- **Educational Purpose**: Safe environment for learning and demonstration

## Technical Architecture

### Core Components

**LimitOrderEngine**: Central orchestration engine that manages order lifecycle, executes TIF policies, and coordinates between components.

**Order Management System**: Handles order creation, validation, tracking, and execution with support for all required TIF policies.

**PriceFetcher**: Multi-source price aggregation system that fetches real-time data from CoinGecko, 1inch, and direct blockchain calls.

**CLI Interface**: Interactive command-line interface with intelligent tracking controls to solve common trading interface problems.

**Blockchain Services**: Direct integration with Ethereum RPC for balance queries, transaction submission, and contract interaction.

### Smart Tracking Feature

One significant improvement I implemented is an intelligent price tracking system that solves a common problem in trading interfaces: price monitoring output interfering with user input during order submission.

**The Problem**: Traditional implementations show continuous price updates that interrupt the user while typing order details, making it difficult to submit orders cleanly.

**The Solution**: Smart tracking commands that give users control over when to see price monitoring:

- **Default State**: Clean, quiet interface with no distracting price updates
- **Track Command**: When users want to see real-time price monitoring, they use `track` or `logs`
- **Close Command**: When submitting orders, users can use `close` to get a clean interface

This approach provides the best of both worlds: detailed price monitoring when needed, and clean order submission when required.

### Order Submission Workflow

The order submission process guides users through all required parameters:

```bash
curve-agent> submit

=== Submit New Limit Order ===
Sell token (USDC/WETH/ETH/DAI): USDC
Buy token (USDC/WETH/ETH/DAI): DAI
Amount to sell: 100
Target price (buy per sell): 1.001
Policy (GTC/GTT/IOC/FOK): GTC
Slippage tolerance % (default 0.5): 0.5

[SUBMITTED] Order abc123...: Order added to active queue
Order submitted: abc123... (GTC)

--- Order submitted successfully!
Order ID: abc123...
Policy: Good Till Canceled - Order remains active until filled or manually canceled
```

### TIF Policy Examples

**GTC (Good Till Canceled) Orders:**
These orders remain active indefinitely until the target price is reached or manually canceled. Ideal for patient trading strategies.

**GTT (Good Till Time) Orders:**
These orders include an expiration timestamp. If the target price isn't reached within the specified timeframe, the order automatically cancels.

**IOC (Immediate Or Cancel) Orders:**
These orders attempt immediate execution at the current market price. If the target price cannot be achieved immediately, the order cancels.

**FOK (Fill Or Kill) Orders:**
These orders require complete execution of the entire order amount. If the full amount cannot be executed at the target price, the order cancels entirely.

### Smart Tracking Demonstration

```bash
# Start with clean interface for order submission
curve-agent> submit
# Clean input process without interruption

# Enable tracking to monitor market conditions
curve-agent> track
Price tracking activated! You'll now see real-time price updates.
Use 'close' command to stop tracking and clean up the display.

curve-agent> Fetching real-time price for USDC/ETH
[REAL PRICE] USDC/ETH: 0.000233548 (via CoinGecko)
Real-time price: 0.000233548 ETH per USDC (source: CoinGecko)

# Disable tracking for clean interface
curve-agent> close
Price tracking stopped. Display is now clean for order submission.

curve-agent>

   - Quote acceptability validation

3. **Price Utilities** ✅
   - Decimal conversion utilities (6, 18, etc. decimals)
   - Price calculation and normalization
   - Slippage calculation and validation
   - Price target comparison logic
   - Formatting utilities for display

4. **Clean Interface Definitions** ✅
   - IEthereumClient - Blockchain interaction interface
   - ICurveService - Curve protocol interface
   - IERC20Service - Token operations interface
   - IOrderStorage - Order persistence interface

5. **Interactive CLI Framework** ✅ **NEW!**
   - Command-line interface with help system
   - Interactive mode for live trading demos
   - Support for submit, list, cancel, monitor commands
   - Real-time order management simulation
   - Proper command structure for hackathon demo

6. **Order Storage System** ✅ **NEW!**
   - In-memory order storage with JSON logging
   - Thread-safe operations with mutex protection
   - Event logging for audit trail
   - Order querying by status and criteria

7. **Configuration System** ✅ **NEW!**
   - Environment variable support
   - Command-line argument parsing
   - Wallet and network configuration
   - Dry-run mode support

8. **Build System** ✅
   - CMake configuration with nlohmann/json dependency
   - Separate library and executable targets
   - Unit test framework setup
   - Successfully compiles on macOS with Apple Clang

### Test Results:
- ✅ **Core library functionality**: WORKING (demo runs successfully)
- ✅ **Price calculations**: All tests passing
- ⚠️ **Some test assertions**: Minor fixes needed (serialization and quote logic)
- ✅ **Order creation and management**: Working properly

### Key Features Demonstrated:
- Order creation with realistic Ethereum addresses (USDC/WETH)
- Price calculations with proper decimal handling
- Slippage calculations (0.5% default)
- Policy descriptions and validation
- UUID generation for order tracking
- Status management and transitions

## 📋 **Tomorrow's Action Plan:**

1. **Before Starting Timer (30-60 min):**
   - Examine GoCode starter interfaces
   - Plan integration approach
   - Set up environment

2. **First 2 Hours:** 
   - Copy over core components
   - Adapt to starter interfaces

3. **Hours 2-16:**
   - Implement blockchain services

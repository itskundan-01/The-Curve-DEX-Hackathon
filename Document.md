Hackathon Challenge: Building a Curve DEX Limit Order Agent
Objective: Extend a basic C++ swap example to create a sophisticated off-chain agent that executes programmatic trades on the Curve DEX. The agent must manage orders with precise execution controls, including slippage protection and multiple Time-in-Force (TIF) policies (GTC, GTT, IOC, FOK).
Background:
While the Curve protocol executes swaps on-chain, sophisticated trading strategies require off-chain logic. A simple limit order is just the beginning. Professional trading agents must handle execution risk and time-sensitivity. This is achieved through:
Slippage Protection: Ensuring a trade executes within a tolerable price range, even in a volatile market. This is your safeguard against unfavorable price movement during transaction execution.
Time-in-Force (TIF): A set of rules that determine how long an order will remain active before it is executed or expires. Common policies include Good-Till-Canceled (GTC), Good-Till-Time (GTT), Immediate-Or-Cancel (IOC), and Fill-Or-Kill (FOK).
This challenge requires combining on-chain data queries with off-chain decision-making and robust transaction management.

The Starter Code:
You will begin with curve_swap_example.cpp. This file contains three basic examples of how to structure and execute different types of swaps against a Curve pool. Your first task is to understand this code and how it interacts with the blockchain.
The Challenge is Divided into Three Parts:
Part 1: On-Chain Price Monitoring
Your first task is to build a reliable price feed by querying a Curve liquidity pool directly.
Choose an RPC Provider: You must connect to the Sepolia testnet using a free and open JSON-RPC provider (e.g., Alchemy, Infura, or a public endpoint). You will need this to query balances and pool states.
Fetch Balances: Demonstrate that you can use your RPC connection to fetch the balance of ETH and other ERC-20 tokens for a given wallet address.
Calculate the "Instant" Price: Implement a function that repeatedly calls the get_dy or a similar "view" function on a Curve pool contract. This function will tell you, "If I put in X amount of token A, how much of token B will I get out right now?" This is your real-time price feed. You will need to query this price in a loop.
Part 2: Implement the Limit Order Agent
This is the core of the challenge. You will build the logic for the limit order execution, including TIF policies.
Define the Limit Order: Your agent must accept the following parameters for an order:
Input Token & Amount (e.g., 100 USDC)
Output Token (e.g., DAI)
Limit Price: The target price for the swap (e.g., "I will only swap if the price is 1.001 DAI per USDC or better").
Slippage Tolerance: A percentage (e.g., 0.5%) that defines the minimum acceptable amount of output tokens (min_dy) relative to the current market price at the moment of execution. This protects against on-chain price changes while your transaction is in flight.
Time-in-Force Policy: The agent must support GTC, GTT, IOC, and FOK policies.
Create the Execution Logic: Write a flexible loop or execution function that handles all TIF policies:
GTC (Good-Till-Canceled): The agent monitors the price indefinitely and executes when the limit price is met.
GTT (Good-Till-Time): The agent monitors until a specified timestamp. If the price is met, it executes. If the time expires, the order is canceled.
IOC (Immediate-Or-Cancel): The agent checks the price once. If the order can be partially or fully filled at the limit price or better, it executes an immediate swap for the fillable amount. Any unfilled portion is canceled.
FOK (Fill-Or-Kill): The agent checks the price and the pool's liquidity once. The entire order must be fillable at the limit price or better in a single transaction. If not, the order is canceled and no swap is attempted.
Execute the Swap: When the conditions for the price and TIF policy are met, your agent must:
Use the appropriate swap function from the curve_swap_example.cpp starter code.
Construct and sign the transaction.
Send the transaction to the blockchain via your RPC provider.
Part 3: Testing Suite
You must prove that your agent works as expected.
Unit Tests: Create a testing suite for your codebase. This should include tests for your price calculation logic and other critical functions.
End-to-End Test: Write a test that runs the entire flow:
Starts the agent with a limit order that is slightly out of the money (i.e., the target price is not yet met).
(In a real scenario, you'd wait for the market to move. For a test, you might manually execute a separate swap that moves the price in your favor).
The test should assert that once the price is favorable, your agent successfully submits the transaction.
Bonus Task: Wallet Management & Security
For this hackathon, you must demonstrate best practices for wallet security.
Create a New Wallet: Do not use a personal or production wallet. Create a brand new, empty wallet specifically for this hackathon using a tool like MetaMask.
Fund via a Testnet Faucet:
Once you have your new wallet's address, get free Sepolia ETH from a public "faucet." This will provide the necessary funds to pay for gas fees on the testnet.
Good faucets include: sepoliafaucet.com (Alchemy) or infura.io/faucet/sepolia.
Explain in your submission how and why this process is critical for security, contrasting it with the risks of using a mainnet seed phrase.
Submission:
Submit your work through this Google Form: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1SqkTwnfb-07G3VI-TLDrxH8tfrrBW2AmVwbCRcPPyso/edit
Your submission must be a comprehensive package that includes:
Video Demonstration: A short video recording (5-10 minutes) where you:
Walk through your C++ source code, explaining the key components and logic for handling TIF policies and slippage.
Run your program live to demonstrate that it is functional, executing one or two order types (e.g., a GTC order that fills and an IOC order that cancels) on the Sepolia testnet.
Complete Codebase: Your full C++ source code, including the testing suite.
